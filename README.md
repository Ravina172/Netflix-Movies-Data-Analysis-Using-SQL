  the description field. Label content containing these keywords as 'Bad' and all other 
  content as 'Good'. Count how many items fall into each category.

  ## SQL Solutions

- I extracted valuable insights from the unprocessed Netflix dataset by using sophisticated SQL queries and concepts. To guarantee precise and perceptive analysis, each business problem was tackled using meticulously constructed SQL statements that made use of strategies like aggregation, filtering, joins, grouping, and subqueries.

## Results

- With a movie-to-TV show ratio of roughly [placeholder:2.3:1 ], the platform has more movies than TV series.
- [placeholder: "TV-MA"] is the most popular rating for films,and [placeholder: "TV-14"] is the most common rating for TV series.
- Netflix released [517] films in [placeholder year 2020].
